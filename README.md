# IGV-snapshot-nf

An example Nextflow workflow for creating automated IGV snapshots of .bam files based on a list of target regions.

This workflow is designed to show how to integrate [automated IGV snapshotting](https://github.com/stevekm/IGV-snapshot-automator) into a Nextflow workflow.

## Installation

First, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/stevekm/IGV-snapshot-automator.git
cd IGV-snapshot-automator
```

### Containers

Docker and/or Singularity containers are used to package IGV, X11, and `xvfb` required for functionality. Docker is required to build Singularity containers

To build the Docker container for IGV:

```
cd containers
make docker-build VAR=IGV
```

To test out the IGV Docker container:

```
make docker-test VAR=IGV
```

(optional) To build a Singuarity container for IGV, first build the Singularity Docker container:

```
make docker-build VAR=Singularity-2.4
```

- This container is used to build Singularity containers

To build the Singularity container for IGV:

```
make singularity-build VAR=IGV

# test the container:
make singularity-test VAR=IGV
```

- The Singularity container will be saved to `containers/IGV/IGV.simg`, which you can upload to your remote server for usage

# Usage

Run the included demo workflow (from the parent repo directory):

```
make run
```

Should look something like this:

```
IGV-snapshot-nf$ make run
./nextflow run main.nf -profile "docker"
